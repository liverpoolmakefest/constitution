## DRAFT CONSTIUTION

---

**We are the organisers of Liverpool MakeFest.**

We agree that:

# 1. We are members of Liverpool MakeFest

1. In legal terms, **Liverpool MakeFest** (often shortened to “MakeFest”) is an unincorporated association, this document is its constitution, and we (“organisers”) are its members.

# 2. MakeFest has two core objectives

1. To promote and nurture the Maker Community in the Liverpool City Region.
   1. “Makers” are considered to be individuals who create things that exhibit creativity and technical skill, and who encourage others to do the same.
   2. The “Maker Community” can include, but is not limited to, artists, builders, crafters, designers, engineers, and hobbyists, who interact with each other as part of their creative pursuits.
2. To run a free, annual festival for Makers, in Liverpool.
   1. The festival must be free to attend.
   2. The festival must be free from third-party branding.
   3. The festival must be hosted at a location within the Liverpool City Region.
   4. The festival should allow Makers to exhibit and demonstrate their creations and creative processes, to other Makers and to the general public.
   5. Every effort should be taken to ensure diversity amongst the festival’s exhibitors and attendees.

# 3. Anyone can be a member

1. Membership as a MakeFest organiser is open to anyone who is willing to support the work of Liverpool MakeFest, and abide by the rules in this document.
2. Members can do anything in their power to further MakeFest’s core objectives—like raising funds, receiving grants and donations, opening a bank account, or spending funds—as long as they don’t break the law, and they accept personal responsibility for the outcome.
3. Members *cannot* receive any money or property from makeFest, except to refund reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
4. Members must treat each other with respect and professionalism. Bullying, violence, and discrimination will not be accepted under any circumstances. Be awesome to each other.
5. Anyone can stop being a member at any time, providing they give notice and hand over their responsibilities and work-in-progress, as soon as possible, and to the best of their ability.

# 4. We make decisions as a group

1. There are no general meetings, and no votes.
2. Decisions about actions the members can take, changes to this document, or the dissolution of the association, can be made at any meeting of any number of members. We just ask that:
   1. As the organiser of a meeting, you do your best to notify every other member, so they have an opportunity to attend if they want.
   2. If anyone at a meeting disagrees with a decision, you discuss it until a compromise can be reached.
   3. Someone keeps minutes of what was said at meetings, and makes the minutes available to all members for as long as possible.

That’s it! Now go forth, and make MakeFest awesome!
